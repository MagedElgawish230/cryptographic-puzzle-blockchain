# Cryptographic Puzzle Blockchain  
![blockchain_banner](Pictures/blockchain-banner.png)

## 📋 Project Description  
A cryptographic puzzle blockchain system built using Python. This project implements a blockchain structure with dynamic difficulty adjustment, Proof-of-Work (PoW), and a mining process that rewards miners with tokens.

---

## 🌟 Features  
- Blockchain structure with each block containing data, nonce, and previous block hash  
- Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism where miners solve a cryptographic puzzle  
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment based on the mining time of previous blocks  
- Mining rewards given to miners in the form of tokens or points  
- Blockchain validation to ensure integrity and correctness  

---

## 🛠 Requirements  
- Python 3.8 or higher  
- No additional libraries required for basic functionality (standard Python libraries used)  

---

## 📦 Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cryptographic-puzzle-blockchain.git  
   cd cryptographic-puzzle-blockchain  
   ```

2. Install required packages (optional, for virtual environment setup):  
   ```bash  
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  
   ```

---

## 🚀 Usage  
1. Run the main blockchain program:  
   ```bash  
   python main.py  
   ```

2. Observe the mining process and difficulty adjustment.

## ⚙ Configuration  
You can modify the following parameters in `blockchain.py`:  
- `self.difficulty`: Adjust the mining difficulty.  
- `self.mining_time_target`: Set the target block generation time (in seconds).

---

## 📊 Mining Process  
Miners earn rewards by solving a PoW puzzle. The reward is based on the time taken to mine each block.
